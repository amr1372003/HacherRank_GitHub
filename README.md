# HackerRank Problem Saver to GitHub

This is a simple Python script (`main.py`) that helps you save your coding problem solutions (from HackerRank, LeetCode, etc.) into your GitHub repository — each with:

- A separate folder for every problem
- A `README.md` with the problem description and examples
- A source code file containing your solution

---

## 📦 Features

- Saves each problem in a structured format
- Automatically creates folders
- Pushes to your GitHub repo using Git
- Works with any problem-solving platform (manual copy-paste)

---

## 📁 Important

⚠️ `main.py` **must be placed inside the local folder of your GitHub repository on your computer** (i.e. the repo must be cloned locally). This is required so that file creation and git commands work properly.

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone your GitHub repo locally (if you haven’t already):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
